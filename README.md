In order to win, player need to answer 3 questions correctly.
The first two questions can be seen after player pays the fee.
You have to answer the first question right in order to move to the next.
Each right answer will give you 1 points. Player who collect 3 points will be the new owner of the game.

When you answer the first question right, you will get the first half of the key,
when you answer the second question right, you will get the second half of the key.
Use the whole key as the hash of ipfs file, go to https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/ + the key you have by answering the right questions to see a video that the game maker stored before.
